## Creative Commons FAQ Bot

The primary motivation for this Bot was to create some sample code to show some sample code that utilizes [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com) and  [Microsoft QnA Maker](https://qnamaker.ai).

I am using some of the [Creative Commons FAQ content](https://creativecommons.org/faq/) for the Qna Maker Knowledgebase and using [botbuilder-cognitiveservices](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder-CognitiveServices) Node library for the integration. I am also using a small talk module prepared by Alyssa Ong for handling things like greetings and such. It's a pretty cool project for using QnA Maker for handling intents and script replies. Check it out: [Small Talk Module for the Microsoft Bot Framework](https://github.com/alyssaong1/botframework-smalltalk). As a result of this, the code here also shows how a Bot can be made to use multiple knowledgebases/recognizers.

You can access the Bot's [website](https://creativecommonsfaqbot8d8.blob.core.windows.net/www/index.html) to converse with it if the website is still up and running.
