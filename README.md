## Creative Commons FAQ Bot

The primary motivation for this Bot was to create some sample code to show some sample code that utilizes [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com) and  [Microsoft QnA Maker](https://qnamaker.ai).

I am using some of the [Creative Commons FAQ content](https://creativecommons.org/faq/) for the Qna Maker Knowledgebase and using [botbuilder-cognitiveservices](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder-CognitiveServices) Node library for the integration.
