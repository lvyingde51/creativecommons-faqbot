What is Creative Commons and what do you do?	{"answer":"Creative Commons is a global nonprofit organization that enables sharing and reuse of creativity and knowledge through the provision of free legal tools. Our legal tools help those who want to encourage reuse of their works by offering them for use under generous, standardized terms; those who want to make creative uses of works; and those who want to benefit from this symbiosis. Our vision is to help others realize the full potential of the internet. CC has affiliates [all over the world](https://creativecommons.org/international/) who help ensure our licenses work internationally and who raise awareness of our work. Although Creative Commons is best known for its licenses, our work extends beyond just providing copyright licenses. CC offers other legal and technical tools that also facilitate sharing and discovery of creative works, such as [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/choose/zero/), a public domain dedication for rights holders who wish to put their work into the public domain before the expiration of copyright, and the [Public Domain Mark](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0), a tool for marking a work that is in the worldwide public domain. Creative Commons licenses and tools were designed specifically to work with the web, which makes content that is offered under their terms easy to search for, discover, and use. For more information about CC, our [main website](https://creativecommons.org/) contains in-depth information about [the organization](https://creativecommons.org/about/), its [staff and board of directors](https://creativecommons.org/staff/), its [history](https://creativecommons.org/about/history), and its [supporters](https://support.creativecommons.org/supporters). You can also read [CC case studies](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/Case_Studies) to learn about some of the inspiring ways CC licenses and tools have been used to share works and support innovative business models.

What are Creative Commons licenses?	{"answer":"[Creative Commons licenses](https://creativecommons.org/licenses) provide an easy way to manage the copyright terms that attach automatically to all creative material under [copyright](https://creativecommons.org/faq/#What_is_copyright_and_why_does_it_matter). Our licenses allow that material to be shared and reused under terms that are flexible and legally sound. Creative Commons offers a core suite of six copyright licenses. Because there is no single Creative Commons license, it is important to identify [which of the six licenses](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) you are applying to your material, which of the six licenses has been applied to material that you intend to use, and in both cases the specific version.",   "type":"default",   "followUps":[      "Are Creative Commons licenses enforceable in a court of law?"]}	Editorial
Are Creative Commons licenses enforceable in a court of law?	{"answer":"Creative Commons licenses are drafted to be enforceable around the world, and have been [enforced in court](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/Case_Law) in various jurisdictions. To CC's knowledge, the licenses have never been held unenforceable or invalid. CC licenses contain a severability clause. This allows a court to eliminate any provision determined to be unenforceable, and enforce the remaining provisions of the license.",   "type":"default",   "followUps":[]}	Editorial
